Description: efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors
 Faiss is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense
 vectors. It contains algorithms that search in sets of vectors of any size, up
 to ones that possibly do not fit in RAM. It also contains supporting code for
 evaluation and parameter tuning. Faiss is written in C++ with complete wrappers
 for Python/numpy. Some of the most useful algorithms are implemented on the
 GPU. It is developed by Facebook AI Research.
 .
 This package contains the development files.
